In this blog, I affirmed that it doesn't matter what gender you are if you work as a developer, but I still think it does.
so I chose to look at the public Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results' annual database. In 2019, 64,883 respondents completed the poll, which included questions about the type of code used, work status, education level, and career happiness and asked this questions : 
* Is there a programming language that is preferred by a particular gender over another?
* what is the gender distribution of developers in each country?
* Is there a difference in working hours between men and women?
* How many programming learner are there in each gender?


and This is what I discovered after asking these  questions



## Is there a programming language that is preferred by a particular gender over another?

#### actually no, javascript, sql, and java are the most popular programming languages for both men and women, according to the analysis. so we try to now the number of devloper in each gender by asking


## what is the gender distribution of developers in each country?

#### In the first question, we found out that male developers are more than female, which led us to think that male developers work longer hours. 
#### Surprisingly, there is a significant disparity between male and female developers in this regard.
for example, According to the data, the number of male developers in the United States outnumbers the number of female developers by 88%. 

#### So, we decide to ask our next questions to be more clear about our analysis,

## Is there a difference in working hours between men and women?

#### We were surprised to learn that in many nations, women work longer hours than males.

## How many programming learner are there in each gender?

#### Finally, we'd like to determine which gender is most interested in learning about programming by looking at the number of students in each gender.



## Many inferences have been taken from the questions posed. Here's a brief overview of a few:

* There is no preferred language for a given gender, and programming languages are not a classifier measure between males and females.
* Whether working as a professional developer or as students, males are the dominate gender.
* In some countries (with a high percentage of male developers), female developers work longer hours than male developers, which may influence their decision to study programming.
