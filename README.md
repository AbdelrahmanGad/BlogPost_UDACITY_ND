## Project Description:
The goal of this investigation is to see if gender plays a role in the development industry. 
As a result, I set out to address the following questions in my study, based on data obtained by Stack Overflow as part of their 2018 Annual Developer Survey:
* Is there a programming language that is preferred by a particular gender over another?
* what is the gender distribution of developers in each country?
* Is there a difference in working hours between men and women?
* How many programming learner are there in each gender?


## Libraries:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* sklearnrn
* collections
